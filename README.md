# Snaps


For people who read a lot online:

Inconvenience of navigating multiple sources for saved articles or news

Crowded reading lists or cluttered bookmarks

Want quick access to key information inside of entire article


Introducing Snaps, a versatile web application designed to curate and store articles effortlessly. 

Users can save URLs of interest in their account cache, creating an organized repository of content. The cache/articles page showcases each entry with a title, the original URL, and a concise "snap," providing a summary of the content. On the dedicated "Add Snap" page, users can seamlessly input new URLs. Here's where Snaps stands out: upon submission, our application leverages the OpenAI API to analyze the article text and generate key-point summaries. Users have the flexibility to review and edit the AI-generated summaries before saving them into their personalized Snaps account. This innovative feature ensures a curated collection tailored to each user's preferences and requirements.
